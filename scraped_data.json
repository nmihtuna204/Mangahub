Thousands line up in San Diego to travel over six thousand kilometers for a chance to win the grand prize of fifty million dollars. With the era of the horse reaching its end, contestants are allowed to use any kind of vehicle they wish. Competitors will have to endure grueling conditions, traveling up to a hundred kilometers a day through uncharted wastelands. The Steel Ball Run is truly a one-of-a-kind event.  The youthful Johnny Joestar, a crippled former horse racer, has come to San Diego to watch the start of the race. There he encounters Gyro Zeppeli, a racer with two steel balls at his waist instead of a gun. Johnny witnesses Gyro using one of his steel balls to unleash a fantastical power, compelling a man to fire his gun at himself during a duel. In the midst of the action, Johnny happens to touch the steel ball and feels a power surging through his legs, allowing him to stand up for the first time in two years. Vowing to find the secret of the steel balls, Johnny decides to compete in the race, and so begins his bizarre adventure across America on the Steel Ball Run.",

As if by chance, as if by fate, the two keep meeting and discover that their favorite artist is the indie musician “Long Afternoon.” They gradually grow closer and so the story began.\n\n---\nEvery night, Yeo-un takes the last train home—same route, same time, same routine.

But Hae-in isn’t just another fan—she’s the voice behind the band, a secret she can’t afford to reveal. As music draws them closer, the truth may threaten to pull them apart. When the final note plays, will their story end in harmony… or heartbreak?",

Saki stutters an apology, but the girl simply hands back her sheet music and leaves without a word. Saki begins her first day of high school the following morning, only to find the stranger from the night before sitting at the desk next to hers.

Though Kanon needs to be close to people to read their lips, she tends to push people away with her icy demeanor. Through one kind gesture, Saki slowly begins breaking down the walls around Kanon, even as she feels something new blossoming within her.",

However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn't study for. The art style is cute but mixes with extreme expressions and action sequences for surprising comedy bits.\n\n(The original magazine run ends at Chapter 192)",

However, his bad attitude comes from the fact that he has a sleeping disorder, and frequently spends nights on end without a single minute of sleep. During the preparations for the school festival, he is begrudgingly sent to the school's astronomy observatory to gather cardboard boxes, a place which is said to be haunted by the dire happenings of the now defunct Astronomy Club. He finds the isolated place a haven ripe for him to sleep, but while rummaging around, he stumbles upon his classmate Magari Isaki sleeping inside a toppled-over locker.   \n  \nIsaki, unlike him, is a personable and popular girl at class, but who also hides her own problems with insomnia. Looking for a middle ground, they find that there's comfort and ease in sleeping together, so they resort to make the observatory their own private cubby to sleep… Have they found the comfort they're looking for?",

But marked as one of the enigmatic Branch-hexed, and gifted with the strange ability to see the sound of his instrument, Luca finds himself drawn reluctantly into a war of epic proportions!\n\nLeft for dead after a battle, Luca is saved by the mysterious Pontiff and learns he is not the only person with unusual powers. The Pontiff has formed a special team of Branch-hexed individuals he plans to use to help him defeat rival empires, and Luca learns that his powers, rather than being an escape from the battlefield, now force him to be a muse of massacre.",

He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.  \n  \nUpon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.  \n  \n\n\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**  \n- Because some groups use the web version of the manga while others use the magazine version, the numbering won't match between different languages.  \n- **Because a takedown notice was sent to MangaDex from the owners of this series, fan translations of One Punch Man are currently unavailable to be uploaded.

Fuji has erupted within living memory. \nThe population has been considerably reduced and political and technological institutions have broken-down. \nLocal communities have become nations and telephone and television no longer exist (although coffee vending machines and streetlights stubbornly continue to work). \nThere are strange new animals and plants (like flying fish and glowing streetlight trees).  \n  \nThe remaining people have adopted a slower-paced, simpler way of life and rely more on each other. Along with the human population are some intelligent, humanoid robots. \nOne of the robots, a female named Alpha, runs a café by the same name in the country outside of what remains of Yokohama. \nWith her trusty motor scooter and her camera she travels around the area making friends with the humans and robots, \nhaving new experiences and observing the passage of time.  \n\n---  \n- **Won the 2007 Seiun Award for Best Manga**",

Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.\n\nIn the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.\n\nAn Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.\n\nBut An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…\n______\n\n**Silver Award winner at the 12th Chinese Nebula Awards for Chinese Science Fiction**",

Kenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop. Kenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n--- \n**Awards Won:**\n\n- Winner of the 25th [Kodansha Manga Award]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodansha_Manga_Award) for General Manga in 2001.\n- Winner of the 48th [Shogakukan Manga Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogakukan_Manga_Award) for General Manga in 2002.\n- Winner of the 2008 [Seiun Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiun_Award) for Best Comic at the 46th Japan Science Fiction Convention.\n- Winner of the 2011 [Eisner Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Awards#Past_winners) for Best U.S. Edition of International Material-Asia.\n\n---\n  \nSee [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/manga/3/20th_Century_Boys) for Manga Details.\n\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Boys)",

But with deceitful characters on all sides, can Roxana and Cassis trust each other enough to bring down the brutal Agreces?\n\n---\nI accidentally took possession of someone in a 19+ reverse harem novel.\n\nThe problem is that I became Roxanna Agriche, the older sister of the sub-villain.

Being intellectual and the new transfer student, he has always been seen as an outcast and all Kaoru had to do was bear it until the next time he moved. But things were slightly different this time. First, he started to get close to the class president, Mukae Ritsuko, and, secondly, unlikely as it seemed, grew closer to Kawabuchi Sentaro. Sentaro was infamous for getting into fights, skipping class and was an overall bad boy. Strangely enough, the three of them find common ground in music, namely jazz, and Kaoru finds himself actually enjoying the new town.  \n\n---  \n- It won the 57th Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga.  \n- Volumes 1-6 contain unrelated oneshot extras at the end.\n\n\n---\nOfficial Release:\n- Indonesian release by Elex Media as **Apollon on The Slope** (2010; including Bonus Track)",
